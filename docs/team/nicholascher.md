### Project: FreelanceBuddy

**Overview:** FreelanceBuddy is a **powerful and efficient Command Line Interface (CLI) 
optimised app designed for freelancers**.
It's a one-stop solution for freelancers, helping them manage multiple clients, track project statuses, 
and stay on top of their financial reports. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Finance UI
  * What it does: Displays the finances that the users input into FreelanceBuddy
  * Justification: Tracking and managing finances is one of the most important aspects of a freelancer's job. 
  Our aim was to provide a clean and simple interface, so that freelancers are able to easily view all their finances.
  * Highlights: The finances are color coded based on their type. Expenses are given a red font while commissions 
  are given a green font. This helped to provide a more intuitive overview of the finances.

* **New Feature**: Filter by client name
  * What it does: Filters all the finances by client name
  * Justification: We expect full time freelancers to have many clients, hence there will be a need for them to 
  filter all the finances by the client name.
  * Highlights: Provides users with a clear breakdown of their finances by client.

* **New Feature**: Filter by time frame
  * What it does: Filters all the finances by the given time frame
  * Justification: Freelancers will want to view all the finances that they have in a given time frame. For example,
  they might want to view all the finances they had over the past month. 
  * Highlights: Provides users with a clear overview of their finances within a given timeframe.

* **New Feature**: Summary command
  * What it does: Provides a summary of the finances for a given client
  * Justification: It is often difficult for freelancers to accurately gauge whether a client is worth their time.
  Hence, we felt that it would be beneficial for us to provide a simple command that will help provide a quick overview
  of a client's finances.
  * Highlights: Provides the user with a comprehensive breakdown, showing a total profit/loss, and the totals for 
  commission and expenses respectively. 



* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=nicholascher&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22)

* **Project management**:
    * Made the labels for tagging
    * Helped to set up and close milestones v1.1, v1.2, v1.2b and v1.4

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * **Add ParseCommandHandler**
    * What it does: Helps to manage which parser is used for each tab
    * Justification: We have three separate tabs, and the tabs have some overlapping commands. For example filter-n
      should have a different response depending on if the user is in the Finance or Events tab.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the following features: `add-c`, `filter-c`, `filter-t`, `summary`
    * Developer Guide:
        * To be added

* **Community**:
    * To be added

* **Tools**:
