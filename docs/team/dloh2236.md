### Project: FreelanceBuddy

**Overview:** FreelanceBuddy is a **powerful and efficient Command Line Interface (CLI)
optimised app designed for freelancers**.
It's a one-stop solution for freelancers, helping them manage multiple clients, track project statuses,
and stay on top of their financial reports.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Contacts (Modify for FreelanceBuddy)

  * Justification: Contacts with relevant fields are important for freelancers to keep track of important information of their client. 
  * Highlights: Allows user to key in important information for their Client in a contact book, while certain fields are optional, providing flexibility.

* * **New Feature**: Events
  * What it does: Displays events that the user inputs into the application.
  * Justification: Events are a crucial part of a freelancer's life. They need to be able to keep track of their
    events and deadlines. The Event logging allows them to be on task and not miss any deadlines.
  * Highlights: This feature allows the user to view all their upcoming events in chronological order.

* **New Feature**: Event Filter by Client
  * What it does: Allows users to filter their events by their clients
  * Justification: As freelancers have many events, they need to be able to filter their events by client to find the
    relevant events tagged to specific clients.
  * Highlights: Results are chronological and the user can view all their events in one place. It is case-insensitive.

* **New Feature**: Add Event Parser
  * What it does: Allows users to add events to the application, with compulsory and optional fields. User is also able to tag multiple clients that they have added into their contacts to the event.
  * Justification: We felt that the fields which were optional were widely used in the freelancing
    space, but were not exactly necessary. Hence, we included them but made them optional. We allowed user to tag clients so that they can clearly see what clients are tagged to the event.
  * Highlights: optionality of certain fields. tagging of clients.

* **New Feature**: Date-Time Parser
  * What it does: Allows for wide variety of date-time parsing as well as some natural language processing date-time parsing. 
  * Justification: Allows for quick CLI date-time input for user, further optimising the CLI experience.
  * Highlights: Wide variety of formats, Natural Language Date-time formats, Smart Parser that helps infer dates and times.

* **New Feature**: Tab Command
  * What it does: Allows user to use CLI to transition between tabs quickly
  * Justification: CLI way to naviagte between tabs
  * Highlights: fast tabbing with CLI commands.

* **New Feature**: Clear Methods in All Tabs
