### Project: FreelanceBuddy

**Overview:** FreelanceBuddy is a **powerful and efficient Command Line Interface (CLI)
optimised app designed for freelancers**.
It's a one-stop solution for freelancers, helping them manage multiple clients, track project statuses,
and stay on top of their financial reports.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Filter by finance type (commission/expense)
  * What it does: Filters all the finances by their type
  * Justification: Full-time freelancers are likely to have many finance entries recorded in the FreelanceBuddy finance tracker, especially if they are committed to logging their personal finances as well.
Therefore, it is important to filter the entries by type so that freelancers can have an easier time locating the entries that they want to find.
  * Highlights: The `list` command allows three different inputs leading to three different outcomes (commission only, expense only, all entries).
It also works on an already filtered list, such as one that is already filtered by client name.
