### Project: FreelanceBuddy

**Overview:** FreelanceBuddy is a **powerful and efficient Command Line Interface (CLI)
optimised app designed for freelancers**.
It's a one-stop solution for freelancers, helping them manage multiple clients, track project statuses,
and stay on top of their financial reports.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Filter by Company
  * What it does: Filters the contacts by company instead of name of contacts
  * Justification: In case freelancers forget the name of client, but they remember the company name
  * Highlights: Similar to filter by name

* **New Feature**: Edit events
  * What it does: Edit events using any parameter
  * Justification: In case freelancers need to reschedule or adjust event details
  * Highlights: Allows editing set of clients (that exists in contacts), but once it edits, it no longer validates whether clients exist or not.

* **New Feature**: Edit finance
  * What it does: Edit finance using any parameter
  * Justification: In case freelancers made a mistake manually and need to readjust the values/client linked
  * Highlights: Allows editing of client (that exists in contacts), but once it edits, it no longer validates whether client exists or not

* **New Feature**: Tabs
  * What it does: Allows users to navigate between tabs
  * Justification: Collaborating all the 3 different components into one app for easy access for freelancers. 
    * Looks cleaner than putting all 3 sections in one screen.
  * Highlights: Allows using the `tab` command implemented by @dloh2236 to navigate the tabs instead of clicking them.


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=flexibo&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22)

* **Project management**:
  * Check for code quality throughout the project

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * For the edit method in finance, I was unable to use the edit command from contacts, so 
  * Make 3 different 
  * Refactor the tab command to make use of a Tab object

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Edit commands for events and finance
    * filter-n and filter-c commands for contacts
    * Adding hyperlinks
    * Overall make sure that the UG is standardized as much as possible
      * Very time-consuming
  * Developer Guide:
    * Add tab change implementation
      * 
    * Update storage UML diagram 
    * Add test cases for storage
