### Project: FreelanceBuddy

**Overview:** FreelanceBuddy is a **powerful and efficient Command Line Interface (CLI)
optimised app designed for freelancers**.
It's a one-stop solution for freelancers, helping them manage multiple clients, track project statuses,
and stay on top of their financial reports.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Events
  * What it does: Displays events that the user inputs into the application. 
  * Justification: Events are a crucial part of a freelancer's life. They need to be able to keep track of their 
  events and deadlines. The Event logging allows them to be on task and not miss any deadlines.
  * Highlights: This feature allows the user to view all their upcoming events in chronological order.

* **New Feature**: Event Filter by name
  * What it does: Allows users to filter their events by their name
  * Justification: As freelancers have many events, they need to be able to filter their events by name to find the 
  relevant events.
  * Highlights: Results are chronological and the user can view all their events in one place. It is case-insensitive.

* **New Feature**: Event Filter by date
  * What it does: Allows users to filter their events by their time
  * Justification: As freelancers have many events, they need to be able to filter their events by time to find the
    relevant events.
  * Highlights: Results are chronological and the user can view all their searched events in one place from the 
  specified date to today.

* **New Feature**: Event Card
  * What it does: Allows users view important information about their events in a card format
  * Justification: We needed to display the information in a more user-friendly way. The card format allows the user to
    view the information in a more concise manner.
  * Highlights: Only details which exist are shown in the card.

* **New Feature**: Add Contact Parser
  * What it does: Allows users to add contacts to the application, with additional and optional information such as 
  address and Telegram handle.
  * Justification: We felt that the fields which were optional were widely used in the freelancing
  space, but were not exactly necessary. Hence, we included them but made them optional.
  * Highlights: optionality of certain fields.
